This task deals with a core program around which an operating system is built and that is "Kernel" 

While doing this task I got to know that Kernel acts as an intermediary between our laptop's hardware and software , providing an abstract interface for user applications . 

And also got to know about various topics about what a kernel is ,how it plays an role in system stability , performance and security .

And in this task we have to build a kernel using rust , in this we were given with a rust kernel with errors and we were supposed to decode it and fix all the errors present in it . 

This task was very intersting to do , but due to time constraint I did till installing all the required packages and  setting up rust (installing rust nightly ) and was in middle of fixing the code , but was unable to complete it .
