This task deals with a core program around which an operating system is built and that is "Kernel" 

While doing this task I got to know that Kernel acts as an intermediary between our laptop's hardware and software , providing an abstract interface for user applications . 

And also got to know about various topics about what a kernel is ,how it plays an role in system stability , performance and security .

And in this task we have to build a kernel using rust , we were given a kernel code in rust which has errors in it. We are supposed to debug and fix the code.

This task was very intersting to do , but due to time constraint I could only install required packages(rust nightly, etc ) and setup. I started reading the code and understand it and could not complete it in given time.
