## FLUTTER JUMPSTART:
This task is all about creating a 2D game in which there is a bunny and some navigation arrows and with the help of those arrows the bunny will move around the screen .

For this task we need to install flutter and we can do it with the help of flutter installation present in the given repo 

Then set up flame engine , which is an open source 2D game devlopment framework built on top of the Flutter and it's written in Dart .

We can import flame packages from dart package repo called pub.dev (this is an official source for dart and flutter libraries), then add dependencies in pubspec.yaml file present in our flutter project .

We can go through the resources present in the amfoss git repo to set up everything and then comes the part of coding 

  all the coding is done in lib folder and named as main.dart and jumpstart_game.dart , in here main.dart is the starting point of the code form where code gets executed .

Then comes the part of jumpstart_game.dart ,here lies the main part of the code 

After the code is done we can run it by the command "flutter run " .

#### MY REVIEW :
Creating a 2D game was fun but it was a bit challenging , for this I had to go through so many new concepts and learnt dart (only the part that was required to complete this task ) .
