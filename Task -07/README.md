## EXTENSION :
 In this task we are supposed to create an Weather extension in which we can check the location of any place , and this needs to be done using html , css and js 
 
 For any extensions the main part is "manifest.json file ", this file contains metadata about the extension, including permissions , backgrounds and actions . In this file we can include the icons for our extension logo. The extension starts working from manifest.json file this file consists the path for .html file 
 
 Next comes html file , this file consists the links for css and index.js and some basic html stuff which is required to create an extension 
 
 Then comes the css and js part , this is same as before,all we have to do is include all the styling part into css and all the functions related to weather such as api's ,details related to time , and functions related to displaying them into .js file 
 
#### MY REVIEW:
 Since I already had an experience with html , css and js , this was not that difficult to do , but I have learnt a new thing out of this task , I got to know about manifest.json file , how it works and why do we use it ...
