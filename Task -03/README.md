## Drum kit !
To do this first we have to clone the given repo to our local device and then 

### PART -1:
For this part we need to setup our vs code and link the given styles.css and index.js files to our index.html file 
 we can use the given reference metrial from w3 schools and add the external style sheet in the head part of the html code and .js file to the ending part of the body code .
 
### PART -2:
In this part we are asked to add different sounds to different buttons on our drum kit .
To do this:
We need to add the onclick funtion for those buttons , so that when they are clicked the effect of clicking them is seen , then we need to add the links provided for the songs to that respective button , with the help html and we need to add functions using js and add them in index.js file.

### PART -3 and 4:
In this with the help of css we have to add backgroud colour, box colour,box shader also and have to do some styling to our drumkit .
We can add fonts to our buttons and all the content present on the website .
We can get access to these fonts on google fonts and are easy to use .
